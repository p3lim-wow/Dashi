# Dashi

Dashi is a boilerplate that simplifies addon creation.

Yes, the name is a pun.  
Yes, you can use this if you want.  
No, you should not depend on it being stable.

It contains, among many things, simplifications for:

- event handling
- [deferring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises)
- localization management
- settings and savedvariables
- widgets (buttons, scrollboxes, etc)
- input and output
- misc utility

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/p3lim-wow/Dashi/wiki) for usage.
